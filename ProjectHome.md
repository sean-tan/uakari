Uakari simplifies the process of downloading files from rapidshare.com by fully automating the search and download process.

It not only searches the internet for rapidshare links but also for textual references to rapidshare files (text that is not hyperlinked).  Uakari ignores any broken links and deleted rapidshare content.  It resumes downloads from one session to the next and achieves very fast download speeds, far fast than though a web browser.

Uakari requries java 1.5 (or greater) installed.  To get started visit the downloads page and click on the [jnlp](http://uakari.googlecode.com/files/uakari.jnlp) to launch the application.
